## How to make this program work:

Welcome to this easy quiz.  You'll be quizzed on a few subjects about Full Stack development.

You'll be timed.  However, for each wrong answer you give, you'll be penalized 10 seconds.  The time will come off your timer.

The quiz ends when you have answered all the questions or the timer goes to zero.

The instructions are pretty clear when you come to the website, but you should first note that on the right hand side of the webpage, you'll see the timer.  This tells you how much time is remaining once you start the quiz.

The next thing you'll note is the Start Quiz button, about in the center of the screen.  Click this to begin the quiz.

Answer the quiz questions by clicking on the button whose text is written on the button.  The program will bring you the next set of questions.  

At the end of the quiz, you'll be prompted to enter your initials.  After you do so, click the Save button to save the initials to your local storage. Your initials, along with your score, will be displayed in the upper-left corner.  This will not change until you take the quiz again.

Refresh the page to see that indeed your initials and score were saved.  If you want to play again, just click the Restart Quiz button.
